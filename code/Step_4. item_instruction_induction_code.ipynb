    "**Types of Products:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tangible Products:** Physical goods, such as food, clothing, electronics, cars, etc.\n",
    "2. **Intangible Products:** Services, experiences, or ideas, such as consulting, education, healthcare, software, etc.\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Products:** Combination of tangible and intangible elements, such as a restaurant meal (tangible food + intangible service).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Apple iPhone (tangible product)\n",
